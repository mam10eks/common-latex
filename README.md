# Common Latex

My personal common latex configs.

Used as submodule in other latex-documents.

A latex starter (with other convenience helpers) could be found in [mam10eks/latex-archetype](https://github.com/mam10eks/latex-archetype).

## Usage

Import this repository as submodule with the name `common` into
the root of a third latex source directory.

E.g.:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:mam10eks/common-latex.git common
```

Now have fun :)
