# Common Latex

My personal common latex configs. Used as submodule in other latex-documents.

## Usage

Import this repository as submodule with the name `common` into
the root of a third latex source directory.

E.g.:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:mam10eks/common-latex.git common
```

Now have fun :)
